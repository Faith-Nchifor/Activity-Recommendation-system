# Activity-Recommendation-system
This is a content-based recommendation system for activities based on Rest, Beauty, Nutrition, and Excercise. It is part of one large project that includes the building of both content-based recommendation and collaborative filtering systems. 
This is a whole learning experience for me and I'm loving it.
There is a lot of text in there, so I'm implementing NLP 
Steps involve data processing, vectorization, and model recommendation.
Unfortunately, the data is confidential, so I cannot share to the public.
